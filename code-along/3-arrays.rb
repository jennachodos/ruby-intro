# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]

p shopping_lists

# Accessing the array
puts foods [0]
puts foods [1]
puts foods [2]
p foods [3]
puts foods [-2]
puts shopping_lists [1][0]


# Add to the array
#.apend and << are both ways to add 
foods.append("salad")
foods << "fries"
