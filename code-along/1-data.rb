# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers

puts 3
puts 2


# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 3+2
puts 3-2
puts 3*2
puts 3/2.0
puts 7 % 4
puts 5* (2-2)

# Strings
puts "Hello, world"
# Combine strings together
puts "Hello," + "world"
puts "Tacos are delish"
puts "Tacos" * 3

# Variables
#always lowercase (never upper case, and underscore for a space)
food = "Tacos"
number = 3

puts food
puts number

number = 5 
puts food * number


# Combine strings and variables

greeting = "Heyyyyyy"
#way of compressing static text together
welcome_message = "#{greeting}, world!"

# String manipulation
puts welcome_message.upcase
puts welcome_message.reverse
